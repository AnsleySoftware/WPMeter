  <p><strong>What is WPMeter?</strong><br>
  WPMeter tracks your typing speed in real time‚Äîunlike traditional typing tests that only measure copywriting speed. It provides both live and logged averages, giving you insight into your everyday typing habits.</p>

  <p>Whether you're interested in real productivity tracking or just curious, WPMeter makes it easy to monitor your typing performance without interrupting your workflow. Each log entry includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A timestamp</li>
    <li>Duration spent typing</li>
    <li>Number of characters typed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It's also extremely lightweight‚Äîyou'll barely notice it running.</p>

    <li>Optional "Add to Startup"</li>
    <li>Optional logging with timestamped sessions</li>
    <li>Customizable UI <em>(color, transparency, size, and position)</em></li>
    <li>Lightweight and unobtrusive footprint</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Antivirus Software</h2>
  <p>WPMeter may be flagged by some antivirus software due to its use of a global key hook. Please note that this feature is <strong>off by default</strong>.</p>

  <h2>üîê Notes on Global Key Hook</h2>
  <p>
    The global key capture feature allows WPMeter to track your typing speed even when other windows are in focus. This is implemented using a <strong>global key hook</strong>, which is also used by some malicious programs known as keyloggers.
  </p>
  <p>
    WPMeter does <strong>not</strong> log or transmit which keys you press. It only counts keystrokes for the purpose of calculating typing speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, for your own safety, it's recommended to <strong>disable global key capture or close the program entirely</strong> when entering sensitive information such as passwords or financial data.
